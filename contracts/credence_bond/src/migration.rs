/// using the current `IdentityBond` definition.  Missing fields introduced in
/// v2 (`is_rolling`, `withdrawal_requested_at`, `notice_period_duration`)
/// will be populated with their default values (`false` and `0`).

    // iterate over all keys. The SDK does not provide a direct iterator, so we
    // attempt to read a placeholder key. If the contract is called for a
    // specific identity (via other entrypoints) the migration will be triggered
    // there. Here we simply ensure the storage entry for the generic key is
    // upgraded if it exists.
